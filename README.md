## Why

Claude Code sessions pile up fast. You switch models, spawn agents, burn through context, and there's no single place to see what happened or where you left off. claude-stats reads your local session files and gives you a keyboard-driven TUI with everything you'd want: token breakdowns, context usage, model history, and searchable chat logs. No API calls, no config. Just run `claude-stats` (or `cs`).

## Features

### Know which sessions need your attention

Two indicators show up next to session titles when something is waiting:

- **👋** — Claude responded and is waiting for you. Auto-clears after 1 hour or when you open the session.
- **⏳** — A permission prompt or multiselect needs your approval. Title turns red. Clears when you respond in Claude Code or open the session.

Press `X` to clear the indicator on a row, or `C` to clear all at once. Agent sessions never show indicators.

### Monitor MCP connection health

Navigate to the **MCPs** tab (`←`/`→`) to see live status of all your MCP connections. The tab runs `claude mcp list` to probe each server on arrival (~3 seconds):

- `✓` **Connected** (green) — server is responding normally.
- `!` **Needs Auth** (yellow) — authentication expired. Press `Enter` to re-auth in a new terminal tab.
- `✗` **Failed** (red) — server is down or misconfigured. Press `Enter` to attempt re-auth.

Use `↑`/`↓` to select an MCP, `Enter` to re-authenticate, and `R` to refresh. Status re-checks automatically each time you navigate to the tab. Results are grouped by status: failed first, then needs auth, then connected.

### Archive sessions you're done with

Navigate to the **Archive** tab (`←`/`→`) and press `A` to hide a session from the main list. Use `Shift+↑`/`↓` to multi-select, then `A` to archive in bulk. Press `V` to view archived sessions, `R` to unarchive. Agent sessions (`⤷`) are automatically archived with their parent. Archive state persists across restarts (`~/.claude/stats-archive.json`).

#### Getting back to a waiting session

**iTerm2 / tmux:** Press `K` and claude-stats focuses the terminal tab where the session is already running — instant, no new process.

**Other terminals:** Use `c` (new tab) or `C` (open here) to resume. Note: **`--resume` won't replay Claude's last message** if a session is waiting on you. Check the detail view in claude-stats first to read what Claude said, then resume.

### Jump to any running session

Press `K` on the session list or detail view to focus the tab where that session is running. claude-stats matches sessions to processes via PID/TTY. Sessions with a live process show a blue `◆`. If nothing's running, `K` opens a new tab instead.

### See live sessions at a glance

The active session gets a green `●` and a highlighted row. Indicators update every ~1 second (incremental reads), full reload every ~5 seconds.

### Find any session instantly

Start typing to fuzzy-search across session titles, project paths, and model names. Filters in real time.

### Search across all sessions

Press `/` from the session list to search chat content across every session at once. Results filter the list by match count, show hit counts per session, and display a rich context panel with up to 10 snippets — each tagged with the speaker role and highlighted matches. Press `Enter` to open a result; the detail view pre-populates the search so matches are highlighted immediately.

### Search inside conversations

Press `/` in the detail view to search chat messages. Matches highlight in yellow, current match in orange. `n`/`N` jumps between results, viewport scrolls to center each one.

### Track agent sessions

Agent sessions spawned by Claude Code are grouped under their parent. Parent rows show `▸ N agents` collapsed by default — click the arrow (or press `Enter` on the parent) to expand and see each agent. Double-click any row to inspect it. Agents are always archived with their parent.

### Monitor context usage

The detail view shows a color-coded bar (blue → green → red at 80%+), raw token count and percentage, and a category breakdown: system prompts, your messages, tool results, assistant output, images.

### Track token consumption

Input, output, cache read, and cache write tokens per session. The Usage tab (cycle with `Left`/`Right` on the session list) shows weekly rollups per model — Opus, Sonnet, total sessions and messages.

### See git branch and model history

The detail view shows which branch or worktree each session ran on. Sessions that switched models show the full timeline (e.g., Opus 4.5 → Sonnet 4.5). Effort level (low/med/high/max) is tracked per session.

## How to Use

### Session list

Launch `claude-stats` and you'll see your 40 most recent sessions:

| Column | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| Title | Session name (agents prefixed with `⤷`) |
| Model | Active model |
| Effort | LOW / MED / HIGH / MAX |
| Tokens | Total input + output |
| Turns | Conversation turns |
| MCPs | Top 2 MCP servers used |
| When | Time since last activity |
| Duration | Total session time |

The info bar below cycles with `Left`/`Right`: **Branch**, **Path**, **Models**, **Archive**, **MCPs**.

### Detail view

Press `Enter` to inspect a session:

- **Session info** — model, effort, start time, duration, turns, tool calls, MCP usage, git branch
- **Token usage** — output, input, cache read, cache write, total, last-turn breakdown
- **Context window** — gradient bar, category breakdown, remaining capacity
- **Chat history** — scrollable, markdown rendering, code blocks, diff highlighting, expandable tool calls

Press `f` for fullscreen chat. `Enter` expands/collapses all tool diffs. `Left`/`Right` steps through sessions.

### Quick resume

From the detail view: `c` opens in a new terminal tab (claude-stats stays running), `C` replaces claude-stats with the session. Both launch from the session's original working directory. Auto-detects iTerm2, Terminal.app, Warp, tmux, zellij. Run `claude-stats --config-terminal` to set manually.
